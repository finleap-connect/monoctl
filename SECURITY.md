# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the two most recent minor versions.

For example, if `1.4.1` is the most recent versions, we will
address security updates for `1.3.0` and later. Once `1.5.0` is
released, we will no longer provide updates for `1.3.x` releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security problem in Monoctl, please contact the Security Alert Team:
<fcloud-connect@finleap.com>.

The team will help diagnose the severity of the issue and determine how to
address the issue. Issues deemed to be non-critical will be filed as GitHub
issues. Critical issues will receive immediate attention and be fixed as quickly
as possible.
